# **Smart Learning Coach**

## **Overview**

Smart Learning Coach is a desktop Python application designed to help users study more effectively. It uses NLP techniques to process notes, generate quizzes, and track learning progress through a spaced repetition system.

The application is built with a Tkinter GUI, uses scikit-learn, NLTK, and (optionally) Transformers for NLP tasks, stores all data in a local SQLite database, and visualizes progress using Seaborn.

## **Features**

* **Import Notes**: Upload notes from .txt, .docx, or .pdf files, or paste text directly.  
* **AI Summarization**: Automatically summarize long texts using either Transformers (if available) or a TF-IDF fallback.  
* **Quiz Generation**: Generate multiple-choice quizzes from your summaries to test your knowledge.  
* **Interactive Quizzes**: Take quizzes within the app and get immediate feedback. All results are saved to the database.  
* **Spaced Repetition**: A built-in scheduler (inspired by the SM-2 algorithm) tracks your performance on quizzes and tells you when it's optimal to review a topic.  
* **Performance Dashboard**: Visualize your quiz scores, topic strengths, and forgetfulness trends over time with charts generated by Seaborn.

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized into several key Python modules:
```project
.  
├── main.py                 \# Main application file (runs the Tkinter GUI)  
├── db\_module.py            \# Handles all SQLite database interactions  
├── ml\_module.py            \# Core logic for Summarizer, QuizGenerator, and SpacedRepetitionScheduler  
├── file\_module.py          \# Utilities for reading and cleaning text from files (.txt, .pdf, .docx)  
├── visualization.py        \# Generates Matplotlib/Seaborn charts for the dashboard  
├── requirements.txt        \# All Python dependencies  
├── data/                     \# Directory for runtime data (created automatically)  
│   └── slc.db              \# The SQLite database file  
└── models/                   \# Directory for ML models (created automatically)
```
## **Setup and Installation**

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**  
```bash
   git clone \<your-repository-url\>  
   cd \<repository-directory\>
```
2. **Create a virtual environment:**  
```bash
   python \-m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  \# On Windows, use \`venv\\Scripts\\activate\`
```
3. **Install dependencies:**  
   The application relies on several packages. Install them all using pip:  
```bash 
   pip install \-r requirements.txt
   python -m nltk.downloader punkt punkt_tab averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng stopwords
```
*Note: The first time you run the app, nltk will download necessary models (punkt, stopwords, etc.). If you are using the Transformer-based models, they will be downloaded and cached in the /models directory.*  

4. **Run the application:**  
```bash  
   python main.py
```
## **How to Use**

1. Navigate to the **Notes & Summaries** tab.  
2. Upload a file (.txt, .docx, .pdf) using the "Select file" button or paste your notes into the text box.  
3. Enter a unique "Topic name" for your notes.  
4. Click **Summarize & Save**. The AI-generated summary will appear on the right.  
5. (Optional) Click **Generate Quiz from Summary** to create a quiz for this topic.  
6. Go to the **Quizzes** tab.  
7. Select your topic from the dropdown menu and click **Start Quiz**.  
8. After submitting, your score is saved, and your spaced repetition schedule for that topic is updated.  
9. Go to the **Dashboard** tab to see visualizations of your performance over time.

## **Future Improvements**

This is a functional prototype. Future development could include:

* Improving the quality of quiz "distractors" (wrong answers), potentially using a full large language model.  
* Adding user accounts and authentication.  
* Implementing data export/import (e.g., as CSV or Excel) for notes and quiz results.  
* Polishing the UI with icons, loading bars, and native styling.
